Java interview questions for 3 Years Exp

1. Suppose you have a large collection of data that multiple threads need to access simultaneously. How would you handle concurrent modifications in Java to ensure thread safety?
2. Can you explain the difference between HashMap and Hashtable in Java? What are some scenarios where you'd prefer one over the other?
3. In Java, how does the synchronized keyword work internally? Are there any downsides to using it, and if so, what alternatives could you use for handling concurrency?
4. How does inheritance work in Java, and what is the role of the super keyword? Could you give an example of how you might use it?
5. What is polymorphism, and how does method overriding in Java support polymorphism? Can you show a simple example?
6. How does the Comparator interface differ from Comparable in Java? Could you describe a scenario where using Comparator would be necessary?
7. What is the difference between the stack and heap memory in Java? Can you give an example of where variables would be stored in each?
8. Can you explain how a try-with-resources block works in Java? How is it different from a traditional try-catch-finally block?
9. Suppose you are designing a Java application that performs multiple network requests. How would you handle errors to ensure the application remains stable even if some requests fail?
10. What is a lambda expression in Java, and how does it differ from an anonymous class? Could you show an example?
11. Explain the purpose of the final keyword in Java. Can it be applied to classes, methods, and variables? What effect does it have in each case?
12. What is the difference between == and .equals() in Java? How does equals() differ in Object, String, and custom classes?
13. Can you explain how static methods and variables work? Why can’t you override a static method?
14. Describe the concept of immutability in Java. What are some advantages of creating immutable classes, and how would you make a class immutable?
15. You’ve mentioned using SLF4j and Log4j for logging. What kind of logging levels do you use, and how do you decide the level (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) for each log entry?

Coding:

16. Given an array of integers, write a method that returns true if there are two numbers in the array that sum up to a given target. Otherwise, return false.
17. Write a Java method to find the first non-repeating character in a given string. If all characters are repeating, return a special character like '-'.
